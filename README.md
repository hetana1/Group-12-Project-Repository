Drive AI Drive AI is super awesome driving simulator powered by the well - known technology artificial intelligence. As its primary mission, to teach cars how to drive better. It relies on glorious neural networks to train a model and then produce the coolest "driver" children. For this project, we will show you how the AI learns and figures out those tough turns using pygame so it can learn to turn without overcompensating whenever a corner comes up. We hope this project will help younger folks, especially those car enthusiasts who dream of being a race-car driver one day to get excited about machine learning! Let's hit the road!


## Feature

here are


**Realistic Driving Simulation**: Authentic driving physics and detailed tracks.
- **Neural Network Integration**: Train AIs using NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies).
- **Customizable Vehicles**: Select from small, normal, or large cars.
- **Sophisticated AI Training**: Monitor and evolve the AI's performance over time.
- **Interactive Interface**: Easy management of AI training and simulation controls.
- **Challenging Tracks**: Various tracks that test AI capabilities.
- **Collision Detection and Response**: Realistic collision mechanics.
- **Visual and Analytical Tools**: Tools to analyze AI performance.
## Requirement

- Python 
- Pygame
- NEAT-Python

Note: you only may need python configured ide and paste the following command

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you are having trouble kindly refer at the F&Q below.
## Installation guideline

To set up a virtual environment and install the required packages, follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - **Windows:**
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - **macOS/Linux:**
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Game:**

    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

Remember to activate the virtual environment every time you work on the project. To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:

```sh
deactivate
```

## Usage/Examples

After running the code main.py succesfully you may refer this.

1. **Choose the size of car**
- ``choose small,normal,medium``
- `` different car will have a bit different path``
- `` usually small car perform better than big one``

2. **Refer the terminal for generation,fitness,popultion information.**

If you want to skip straight to the result of the car driven then you may see the terminal in which your ide provide.
    
3. **Enjoy the visual aid create in pygame terminal.**

The pygame terminal will be created to visualise the Ai learning growth.

## FAQ

#### Question 1: I couldn't run the program due to missing import in pygame,neat etc.

Answer: 
1. click ``control``+``shift``+``p`` to open the command pallete then search for ``phyton:select interpretor``. 

2. make sure it's same version of you python compiler. if not try selecting ``python anaconda`` or downloading from microsoft/app store for latest version

#### Question 2: how do i modify car size
answer: when the program has been run, it will display a ``small``, ``normal``, ``big`` option. Use your ``cursor`` to click it and the program should run in a bit.

#### Question 3: I see bug and want to report it

Answer: kindly contact us at ``Group12@developer.com``.

#### Question 4: I want to contribute to this project by fixing code

Answer: Submit pull request with description on what is fix and the admin in charge will review it.


#### Question 5: can we ask for help to our project

Answer: Depend on the task, we are happy to help small task with no charge.
